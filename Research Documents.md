## [Assessment of proposed approaches for bathymetry calculations using multispectral satellite images in shallow coastal/lake areas: a comparison of five models](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12517-016-2803-1)

Keywords:

* Bagging
* Boosting
* Bathymetry
* Landsat 8
* Spot 6
* Support vector regression

### Short thoughts:

Good example of a comparison of different systems. It gives insight into the usage of 5 models:

* ensemble regression tree-fitting algorithm using bagging(BAG)
* ensemble regression tree-fitting algorithm of least squares boosting (LSB)
* support vector regression algorithm (SVR)

 two conventional empirical methods

* the neural network (NN)
* Lyzenga generalised linear model (GLM)

Resulting in: *Compared with echosounder data, BAG, LSB, and SVR results demonstrate higher accuracy ranges from 0.04 to 0.35 m more than Lyzenga GLM. The BAG algorithm, producing the most accurate results, proved to be the preferable algorithm for bathymetry calculation.*
This gives hope for the own system and using it as an example.

### Short thoughts:

This research uses 2 empirical models:

* random forest (RF)
* multi-adaptive regression spline (MARS)

and uses 2 conventional empirical methods:

* the neural network (NN) model
* the Lyzenga generalized linear model (GLM)

It says that the best result is : *When compared with echo sounder data, the RF and MASS results outperformed Lyzenga GLM results. Moreover, the RF method produced more accurate results with average 0.25 m RMSE improvements range than the NN model. The RF algorithm produced the most accurate results proved to be a preferable algorithm for bathymetry mapping in the shallow water context*
